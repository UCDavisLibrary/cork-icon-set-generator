# cork-icon-set-generator
Create `iron-iconset` or `ucdlib-iconset` from a folder of svg icons.

Given a directory, the generator will crawl a folder for all svg files, extract their
contents, and merge them into either a single
1.  `iron-iconset-svg` set file which can be used by ```iron-icon```, or
2.  `ucdlib-iconset` file which can be used from `ucdlib-icon`

# Install

```npm install -g @ucd-lib/cork-icon-set-generator```

# Usage

```cork-icon-set-generator <icon-set-name> <directory>```

 - *icon-set-name*: name of the icon set, the file will be named this as well
 - *directory*: directory to crawl
 - *-u*: generate a `ucdlib-iconset` instead of `iron-iconset-svg`
 - *-v*: copy the viewbox from source svg icons if it exists.
 - *-h*: generate an html file with the iconset instead of a js file
 - *--label*: adds a custom friendly label to `ucdlib-iconset`

## Font Awesome
Font Awesome (FA) icons can be incorporated into a cork-icon-set by doing the following before running the above command:
1. Including a `font-awesome.yaml` file in the root of your icon directory
2. Installing the FA icons with `npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`

The `font-awesome.yaml` is a config file that details what icons should be extracted. It is generated by the [FA subsetter app](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/other-topics/subsetter). However, you can create a file without the app. The format lists the icon name and the iconset within `icons` i.e.:
```yaml
icons:
  - chevron-right:
      - solid
  - twitter:
      - brands
```
This only works for the [free icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free).
